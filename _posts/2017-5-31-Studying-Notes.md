<p>I used the settings on this [webpage by The Hyperbolics](http://www.hyperbolics.caths.cam.ac.uk/main.php?section=people&ID=1) for my Anki flashcards.</p>  
<p>TIL that factorials dominate powers of 10 when _n_=25. </p>
<p>I also L the updated way to align images in html. Before, I was using the attribute <code>align="right"</code>.  It is now <code>class="wrap align-right"</code>, where the specifications are in the css style file.  How do you make smart quotes in Markdown?  In this case I was able to just wrap them in a code environment. </p>
