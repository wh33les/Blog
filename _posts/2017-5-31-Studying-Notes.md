I used the settings on this [webpage by The Hyperbolics](http://www.hyperbolics.caths.cam.ac.uk/main.php?section=people&ID=1) for my Anki flashcards.  TIL that factorials dominate powers of 10 when _n_=25.  I also L the updated way to align images in html.  Before, I was using the attribute align="right".  It is now class="wrap align-right", where the specifications are in the css style file.  It is crazy how much CSS I don't know right now.  Of course, the idea is to learn by playing around with this stuff.
