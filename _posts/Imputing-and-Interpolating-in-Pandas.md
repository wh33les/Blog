Aha!  This is my third post today and as I saw last time I made multiple posts in one day I have to add timestamps to the YAML front matter to get the posts to display in the correct order.  Wasn't working for my last two posts until I changed the times to earlier times.  Turns out the time I write is the local time, so even if I write `date: 2024-07-24 18:00:00 -06:00`, which should be noon Mountain Time, it doesn't work because 6p MT hasn't occurred yet.  Confusing, but I guess it works now.

Oh no, now I'm testing out links on my blog and my stackoverflow link goes to someone else's profile.  My ID number is the same as someone else's.  Also, stackexchange is saying I've been a member for 16 days when it's actually been almost 2 months.  Not sure when I'm gonna figure all that out.
