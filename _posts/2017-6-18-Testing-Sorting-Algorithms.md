title: Testing sorting algorithms.  
---
Gilbert & Forouzan recommends testing sorting algorithms with four types of arrays:

Test Case | Sample Data
----------|------------
Random data  | {5, 23, 7, 78, 22, 6 19, 33, 51, 11, 93, 31}
Nearly ordered  | {5, 6, 7, 21, 19, 22, 23, 31, 29, 33, 51, 93}
Ascending ordered  | {5, 6, 7, 11, 19, 22, 23, 31, 33, 51, 78, 93}
Descending ordered  | {93, 78, 51, 33, 31, 23, 22, 19, 11, 7, 6, 5}

Once I am satisfied with my sorting algorithms study page I want to write a C program that tests them all.
