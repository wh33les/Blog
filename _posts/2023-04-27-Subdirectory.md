I am trying to change the url of my blog to wh33les.github.io/blog but I can't figure it out.  I followed the directions for Solution 2 on [this page](https://github.com/jbranchaud/blog/blob/master/_posts/2013-03-02-Running-Your-Jekyll-Blog-from-a-Subdirectory.md) but it didn't work.  I also edited the \_config.yml file by changing the url to https://wh33les.github.io/blog and baseurl to "/blog".  I also noticed in that file I have mathjax set to true, so I don't know why I've also had problems rendering LaTeX in my blog posts.
