I got my Ph. D. in mathematics in 2014 and I have since worked in academia.  I am now looking to broaden my horizons and include in my job searches roles in industry.  This blog is reflections about my progress in learning code (C, Python, JavaScript, and the occasional post about maching learning algorithms!).
